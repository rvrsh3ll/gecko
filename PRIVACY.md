# Privacy Policy for Gecko Extension

## Overview

The Gecko browser extension is designed specifically for security testing purposes, enabling users to identify client-side path traversal vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Information Collection and Usage

Gecko **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal information or user data to external servers or third parties.

Specifically:

- Gecko intercepts HTTP requests made by your browser solely for the purpose of identifying potential client-side path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Gecko reads the URL of the active tab only locally within your browser to function effectively.

At no point does Gecko send intercepted data, URLs, browsing history, or any other user information outside of your local machine.

## Data Security

Since Gecko neither collects nor stores any personal data, there is no risk of unauthorized data access or exposure associated with its usage.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may occasionally be updated. Any changes will be clearly posted on this page with an updated revision date.
